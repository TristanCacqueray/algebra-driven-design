        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <p>
        Hi there. My name is Sandy Maguire and you might know me from <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com">my blog</a> where I write about type-level programming in Haskell.
        </p>

        <p>One of purely functional programming's greatest strengths is its
        powerful abstraction capabilities. We proudly exclaim that our
        functions are referentially transparent, and because of that, our bugs
        will always be shallow. And this is often true.</p>

        <p>10x is often cited as the magic number beyond which technology is
        good enough to overcome network effects. I'm personally convinced that
        functional programming is 10x better than any other paradigm I've
        tried. But if functional programming is so good, why hasn't it yet
        taken over the world?</p>

        <p>This is a very serious question. If we're right about this, why
        haven't we won?</p>

        <p><strong>Algebra-Driven Design</strong> is my answer to this
        question. Functional programming hasn't taken market share because we
        collectively don't yet know how to write real applications with it.
        Abstraction is our language's greatest strength, but all of our "best
        practices" evangelize writing the same procedural code and use the same
        techniques as we would anywhere else.</p>

        <p>Instead of giving up, this book encourages us to take a heavy focus
        on designing leak-free abstractions, on understanding programs so well
        that the code and tests can be largely generated automatically, and on
        finding performance improvements not via intuition, but through
        algebraic manipulation of the program's underlying equations.
        Functional programming affords us so many new possibilities for
        designing and testing better code, but this information is scattered
        and lost in ancient journals. I'd like to change that.</p>
